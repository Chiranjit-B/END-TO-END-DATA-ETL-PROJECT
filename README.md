# 🚀 ETL Pipeline Project: From Raw Data to Actionable Insights 📊

Welcome to this project, which demonstrates a **complete ETL pipeline** that extracts data from various sources, transforms it, and loads it into a structured database. It’s a practical implementation of how to turn raw data into clean, organized data for **analytics** and **business intelligence (BI)**.

# 📜 Project Overview

This project showcases a complete **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** pipeline. We extract data from multiple formats, clean and transform it, and then load it into a **SQL-based database**. The pipeline ensures the data is in the correct format for efficient analysis and reporting, which is essential for **data-driven decision-making**.

# 📂 Files in this Repository

## 1. `ETL_Script.ipynb` 📓
This Jupyter Notebook serves as the main **ETL script**. It handles the extraction of data from the `orders.csv` file, transformation of the data by cleaning and organizing it, and finally loading it into the structured database schema defined by `SQL_DUMP.sql`. 

### **What Does the Script Achieve?**
- **Extraction**: Reads raw data from CSV files and SQL dump files.
- **Transformation**: Cleans missing or incorrect values, formats the data, and applies necessary transformations (e.g., standardizing date formats).
- **Loading**: Inserts the cleaned data into a **PostgreSQL** or any other SQL database using the schema provided in `SQL_DUMP.sql`.

## 2. `orders.csv` 📄
This file contains **raw order data**, including fields like product IDs, customer IDs, order dates, and order quantities. It’s the primary dataset that needs to be transformed into a clean, structured format for loading into the database.

### **What’s Done with This Data?**
- **Cleaning**: Removing or fixing null values, formatting columns, and handling data inconsistencies.
- **Transformation**: Aggregating or modifying the data (e.g., grouping by product ID or customer).
- **Loading**: The transformed data is loaded into the appropriate tables defined in the SQL schema.

---

## 3. `SQL_DUMP.sql` 🗄️
This SQL dump contains the schema for the target database, including the table structures and relationships. After transforming the raw data in the `orders.csv` file, the cleaned data is inserted into this database.

### **Key Tables**:
- **Orders Table**: Stores the transformed order data, allowing efficient querying.
- **Relationships**: The schema defines the relationships between different tables (e.g., orders, products, customers).

# 🚀 How the ETL Process Works:

## 1. **Extract**  
- We pull data from the `orders.csv` file and possibly other sources (not shown in this version).
- The CSV file is loaded into a pandas DataFrame for easy manipulation.

## 2. **Transform**  
- The data is cleaned: handling missing values, normalizing columns (like dates), and removing duplicates.
- Data is then formatted for compatibility with the SQL schema (e.g., converting strings to datetime objects).

## 3. **Load**  
- The clean, transformed data is loaded into a **PostgreSQL** database (or any SQL database) using the structure defined in the `SQL_DUMP.sql` file.
- The data is now ready for querying and analysis.

# 📊 Why ETL Matters?

In modern data-driven environments, **ETL** is critical for transforming raw, unstructured data into usable formats for **business intelligence**. It ensures:
- **Data Integrity**: By cleaning and normalizing the data.
- **Efficiency**: Makes data easier to query and report on.
- **Scalability**: Once set up, the pipeline can handle large amounts of data efficiently.

Without ETL processes, decision-making would rely on incomplete or inaccurate data, leading to **bad decisions**. 📉
